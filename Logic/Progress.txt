First task is complete. Created: Deck, Card, and player objects that interact in a way that will prepare more code for the bridge game. 
Hand sorting was also quite simple to accomplish by giving each card a certain value and giving more "weight" to the suit of the card.

Second task is complete. Function to check if card is valid for a trick is in TrickSystem.

Third task is complete. Function to score a game is in ScoreSystem.
